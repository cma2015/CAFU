### Brief introduction
- CAFU is a Galaxy-based bioinformatics framework for comprehensive assembly and functional annotation of unmapped RNA-seq data from single- and mixed-species samples which integrates plenty of existing next-generation sequencing (NGS) analytical tools and our developed programs, and features an easy-to-use interface to manage, manipulate and most importantly, explore large-scale unmapped reads. Besides the common process of reads cleansing and mapping, unmapped reads extraction and *de novo* transcription assembly, CAFU optionally offers multiple-level evidence evaluation, sequence and expression characterization, and transcript function annotation. Taking advantages of machine learning (ML) technologies, CAFU also effectively addresses the challenge of classifying species-specific transcripts assembled using unmapped reads from mixed-species samples. The CAFU project is hosted on GitHub(https:/github.com/cma2015/CAFU) and can be accessed from http:/bioinfo.nwafu.edu.cn:4001. In addition, in order to enable large-scale analysis, we also provided a standardized Docker image: [CAFU Docker image](https:/hub.docker.com/r/malab/cafu/).


### CAFU Docker image installation
- Step 1: [Docker installation](Docker_installation.md)
- Step 2: CAFU installation from Docker Hub
  ```bash
  # Pull latest version of CAFU from Docker Hub
  $ docker pull malab/cafu
  ```
- Step 3: Qucikly start
  ```bash
  $ docker run -it -p 80:80 malab/cafu bash
  $ cd /home/galaxy
  $ bash run.sh
  ```
  Then you can access CAFU instance via http:/localhost:80
  
  **Note:** Before running docker, Windows or Mac OS users would better configure some options such as **CPUs**, **Memory**, and **Swap** through the whale in the top status bar (for Mac OS). (see figure below)

### UNMAPPED READ EXTRACTION
In this module, we provide an example for each function to show how to perform unmapped reads extraction.
- **Quality control**

  In this function, we implemented FastQC (Andrews *et al*., 2010) to enable users to perform quality control on RNA-Seq data. In this tutorial, we will use a list of single-end RNA-Seq collection file (located in the folder ```/your directory/CAFU/test_data/SE RNA-Seq/```) to perform quality control.
  
  To run this function correctly, upload the files in the folder ```/your directory/CAFU/test_data/SE RNA-Seq/``` with **ZIP** suffix as a collection named as ```SE-RNA-Seq```ï¼ˆsee section **Upload a collection** to see how to upload a list of RNA-Seq datasets as a collection).

  
  ![Quality control](./CAFU_images/Fig10.png)

  
  Finally, click **Execute** to start performing quality control.
  Once the analysis is finished, a basic text (RawData) and a HTML output file (Webpage) will be returned. The HTML output contains:

  - Basic Statistics
  - Per base sequence quality
  - Per sequence quality scores
  - Per base sequence content
  - Per sequence GC content
  - Per base N content
  - Sequence Length Distribution
  - Sequence Duplication Levels
  - Overrepresented sequences
  - Adapter Content

  You can access the output by click results in the history pannel (see figure below).


  ![Quality control](./CAFU_images/Fig11.png)


- **Trim raw reads**

  In this function, poly-A/T is firstly trimmmed using fqtrim (Pertea, 2015), and then high-quality reads (e.g. score > 20) are retained by Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014). The reads shorter than 20bp (in default) are discarded. 
  
  Here, we used the same collection (```SE-RNA-Seq```) with last step (**Quality control**) to trim raw reads.


  ![Quality control](./CAFU_images/Fig12.png)


  For each FASTQ formatted file, CAFU returns two outputs as collections including:

  - ```fqtrim_DATA_ID.fastq```: poly-A/T trimmed RNA-Seq using fqtrim (fqtrim_SRR2144443.fastq in this example).

  - ```Trimmed_DATA_ID.fastq```: High-quality RNA-Seq generated by Trimmomatic (Trimmed_SRR2144443.fastq in this example).
  
 You can access the output by click results in the history pannel (see figure below).
 
 ![Quality control](./CAFU_images/Fig13.png)
 

- **Extract Unmapped Reads**

  This function integrates several bioinformatic softwares including HISAT2 (Kim et al., 2015), SAMTools (Li et al., 2009), and BEDTools (Quinlan et al., 2010) to extract unmapped reads. Firstly, HISAT2 is used to align user-defined high-quality reads to reference genome. Secondly, SAMTools is used to extract unmapped alignments in SAM format from alignments generated by HISAT2 with parameter "-f 4" and converts SAM format to BAM format. Finally, BEDTools is used to convert the unmapped alignments in BAM format to FASTQ format. In addition, CAFU also supports dual RNA-Seq analysis by aligning RNA-Seq data to multiple reference genomes.

  To run this function, three inputs (see figure below) are required.
 
  **Inputs description:**
  
  **Input 1:** A **collection** of reference genome. Upload files (```maize.fa.zip```) in directory ```/your directory/CAFU/test_data/genomes/``` as a collection named as ```Ref_Genome``` (user-defined name). See section **Upload a collection** to learn how to upload a collection.
  
  **Input 2:** A **collection** of trimmed single-end RNA-Seq files (```Trimmed_SRR2144443.fastq```) generated from **Trim Raw Reads**.
  
  **Input 3:** A **regular** file containing mapping-operation information. Upload the file in directory ```/your directory/CAFU/test_data/SE RNA-Seq/mapping_info``` as a regular file.
  
  **Note:** **Input 3** is a semicolon seperated matrix which contains two columns. The first column contains RNA-Seq ID in each experiment. The second column is the corresponding reference genome ID for each experiment.
  ```bash
  SRR2144382;maize
  SRR2144383;maize
  SRR2144384;maize
  SRR2144385;maize
  SRR2144410;maize
  SRR2144411;maize
  SRR2144442;maize
  SRR2144443;maize
  ```
 
  ![Extrat unmapped reads](./CAFU_images/Fig14.png)


  Then click **Execute** to start extracting unmapped reads using CAFU. After finishing this process, the final unmapped reads named as ```all_unmapped_reads.fastq``` and the number of unmapped reads per experiment named as ```Status_of_number_of_unmapped_reads``` (see figure below) will be returned.


  ![unmapped reads output](./CAFU_images/Fig15.png)


- **Remove Contamination**

  As unmapped reads may result from contamination during sampling or RNA-Seq. In this function, potential contamination sequences are removed using Deconseq (Schmieder *et al*., 2011) with user-defined coverage and identity (e.g., 95) by aligning unmapped reads generated from the function Extract Unmapped Reads to a contamination database.
  
  In the current version of CAFU, users can submit a file of customized contamination reference genome sequences to CAFU to generate a contamination database. Besides, we also provide a default contamination database contains 3,529 bacterial and 81 viral reference genomes (downloaded from NCBI on 2018/11/05).

  Here we use the ```Customized contamination database and single-end unmapped reads``` as an example (see figure below):
  
  **Input 1:** A **regular** file of contamination sequences. Upload files (```Cont_seq.fasta```) in directory ```/your directory/CAFU/test_data/others/``` as a regular file.
  
  **Input 2:** A **regular** file of unmapped reads ```all_unmapped_reads.fastq``` generated from the last step **Extract Unmapped Reads**.

  ![remove contamination](./CAFU_images/Fig16.png)

  Click **Execute**, and then the clean reads with FASTQ format ```Clean_unmapped_reads.fastq``` will be returned (see figure below).
  
  ![remove contamination](./CAFU_images/Fig17.png)

  

###  *DE NOVO* TRANSCRIPT ASSEMBLY OF UNMAPPED READS
- **Assemble Unmapped Reads**

  In this function, three steps including ***de novo* assembly of unmapped reads**, **reducing redundancy of transcript fragments**, and **re-assembly transcript fragments** will be sequentially performed to assemble unmapped reads. In this tutorial, we will use the unmapped reads generated from the function ```Extract Unmapped Reads``` as the input (see figure below).

  
  ![unmapped reads output](./CAFU_images/Figure1.png)
  

  Then assembled transcripts named as ```Unmapped_reads_de_novo_assembled_transcripts```  will be returned (see figure below).


  ![assembled transcripts](./CAFU_images/Figure2.png)


### EVIDENCE SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLED TRANSCRIPTS
- **Expression-level Evidence**

  This function allows users to eliminate assembled transcripts with low read coverage and/or low expression abundance, which are likely assembly artifacts. RNA-Seq reads used for **Assemble Unmapped Reads** are mapped with newly assembled transcripts or/and reference transcripts by using bowtie2 (Langmead *et al*., 2012). CAFU calculates the read coverage of assembled transcripts at single-base resolution using BEDTools (Quinlan et al., 2010), and estimates the expression abundance of all transcripts in terms of FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase Million) using RSEM (Li *et al*., 2011). Assembled transcripts with low read coverage (e.g., less than 10) and/or low expression (e.g., FPKM less than 1) in the majority of samples (e.g., 80%) are discarded.

  **NOTE:** RNA-Seq for calculating expression abundance and read coverage of transcripts are used the data used in *de novo* assembly. Thus, users only require to input the newly assembled transcripts from unmapped reads (generated from the function **Assemble Unmapped Reads**) or/and reference transcripts with FASTA format. 
  
  In this tutorial, we will use the assembled transcripts ```Unmapped_reads_de_novo_assembled_transcripts``` generated from the function ```Assemble Unmapped Reads``` as the input (see figure below).

  ![expression-level](./CAFU_images/Fig20.png)
  
  
  Then three files will be returned (see figure below):
  
  ![expression-level](./CAFU_images/Fig21.png)
  
  **Output 1**: ```Read coverage of each transcript in each sample```, a matrix whose rows represent transcripts, and columns represent read coverage.

  **Output 2**: ```Expression abundance of each transcript in each sample```, a matrix whose rows represent transcripts, and columns represent expression abundance.

  **Output 3**: ```Confident transcript ID by Expression-level Evidence```, IDs of confident transcripts filtered by both read coverage and expression abundance results.


- **Genome-level Evidence**
  
  This function can be used to identify *de novo*-assembled transcripts missing from the existing genome annotation. All the assembled transcripts are aligned to the reference genome sequences of the species of interests using GMAP (Wu *et al*., 2005), and the best genomic matches with high identity (e.g., â‰¥ 95%) and coverage (e.g., â‰¥ 95%) are selected. Users can also eliminate assembled transcripts with no introns, which could represent either noise or pseudogenes.
  
  To run this function, four inputs are required including:

  **Input 1**: A **collection** of reference genome sequences of the species of interest. Upload files (```maize.fa.zip, Oryza.fa.zip, Sorghum.fa.zip```) in directory ```/your directory/CAFU/test_data/genomes/``` as a collection named as ```Ref_Genome``` (user-defined name).

  **Input 2**: A **regular** file of assembled transcript sequences generated from function **Assemble Unmapped Reads**. Test data (```assembled_transcript.fasta```) is in directory ```/your directory/CAFU/test_data/others/```.

  **Input 3**: A **regular** file of genome annotation (GFF format) of corresponding species with RNA-Seq samples. Upload the file (```maize.gff3.zip```) in directory ```/your directory/CAFU/test_data/genomes/```.

  **Input 4**: A character indicating the reference genome name (e.g. maize).


  ![genome-level](./CAFU_images/Fig22.png)


  Then four outputs will be returned (see figure below):
  
  ![genome-level](./CAFU_images/Fig23.png)

  **Output 1**: ```Integrated GMAP results of newly assembled transcripts against all reference genome sequences```: GMAP alignment results (coverage and identity) of each assembled transcript against all reference genome sequences.

  **Output 2**: ```Confident transcript information```: Confident transcript information filtered by high coverage and identity.

  **Output 3**: ```The same/similar-intron transcript ID```: Assembled transcript IDs which possess the same/similar intron with corresponding species reference transcripts.

  **Output 4**: ```Novel transcript ID```: IDs of novel transcripts missing in the existing genome annotation.

- **Transcript-level Evidence**

  This function can be used to select assembled transcripts with high similarity comparing to other well-annotated transcripts, such as full-length transcripts generated from single-molecule real-time sequencing and/or high-quality transcripts annotated in closely related species. After aligning assembled transcripts with other well-annotated transcripts with GAMP (Wu *et al*., 2005), CAFU outputs the best transcript alignments with high identity (e.g., â‰¥ 95%) and coverage (e.g., â‰¥ 95%).
  
  To run this function, at least two inputs are required including:

  **Input 1**: A **collection** of reference sequence of well-annotated transcripts, such as full-length transcripts generated from single-molecule real-time sequencing and/or high-quality transcripts annotated in closely related species. Upload files (```ref_trans.fasta.zip, ref_trans_1.fasta.zip```) in directory ```/your directory/CAFU/test_data/Transcripts/``` as a collection named as ```Well-annotated transcript sequences``` (user-defined name).

  **Input 2**: A **regular** file of assembled transcript sequences generated from the function **Assemble Unmapped Reads**. Test data (```assembled_transcript.fasta```) is in directory ```/your directory/CAFU/test_data/others/```.


   ![Transcript-level](./CAFU_images/Figure3.png) 

   
   Then three outputs will be returned (see figure below):
   
   ![Transcript-level](./CAFU_images/Figure8.png)
   
   **Output 1**: ```Integrated GMAP results of newly assembled transcripts against all reference transcript sequences```, GMAP alignment results (coverage and identity) of each assembled transcript against all other well-annotated transcripts.

   **Output 2**: ```Confident transcript information```, Confident transcript information filtered by high coverage and identity.

   **Output 3**: ```Confident transcript ID```, IDs of transcripts that prossess high similarity comparing to other well-annotated transcripts.

- **Protein-level Evidence**

  In this function, coding potential evidence of transcripts is fistly evaluated using CPC2 (Kang *et al*., 2017). Then for coding transcripts, Pfam (Finn *et al*., 2014) will be used to identify putative domains of corresponding protein. 
  
  Here, we use the assembled transcripts ```Unmapped_reads_de_novo_assembled_transcripts``` generated from the function ```Assemble Unmapped Reads``` as the input (see figure below).

  ![Protein-level](./CAFU_images/Fig26.png) 

  Then three outputs will be returned (see figure below):

- **Remove Batch Effect**

  This function can be used to remove batch effect using an R package sva (Leek *et al*., 2012).

  To run this function, there are two required inputs (see figure below) including:

  **Input 1**: ```assembled_transcript_expression``` in the folder ```/your directory/CAFU/test_data/others/```.

  **Input 2**: RNA-Seq sample batch effect information ```Batch information.zip``` is in the folder ```/your directory/CAFU/test_data/others/```.
  
  - **Expample:** Number 1, 2, 3 represent different experiments. The batch information should be:
    ```bash
    SRR001;1
    SRR002;1
    SRR003;2
    SRR004;3
    SRR005;3
    SRR006;3
    ```
